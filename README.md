# ðŸŒŠ Sway â€” Strategy-Based Limit Order Configurator

**Sway** is a modular, programmable limit order configurator that gives DeFi users fine-grained control over how their orders are executed â€” over time or based on price.

This tool was built for a hackathon to explore creative extensions of 1inch Fusion's order framework, allowing users to construct execution strategies using TWAP, Range Limit, or Dutch Auction logic, all while referencing real-time price data from Chainlink oracles.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Strategy Composer UI**: Users can visually define custom order logic using one of:
  - **TWAP (Time-Weighted Average Price)**: break orders into equal-sized chunks at fixed time intervals
  - **Range Limit Order**: gradually sell across a price range
  - **Dutch Auction**: decay the price over time until filled
- **Single Transition Rule**: Choose either time-based or price-based switching between strategies
- **Order Direction Support**: Supports both **buy** and **sell** orders
- **Market Price Listeners**: Optional fill prevention logic based on live Chainlink oracle data
- **MetaMask Wallet Integration**: Connect wallet, preview strategy, sign and deploy on-chain
